# No-fi Prototype #

In prototyping, there is high fidelity prototyping, and mid- and low- fidelity prototyping. Well, here is No-fidelity prototyping.

It uses TiddlyWiki in order to rapidly prototype using the keyboard only.

## Installation ##

**1.** Run this:
```
[sudo] npm install -g tiddlywiki
```

**2.** Download zip file of this repository and expand it

**3.** Navigate just *outside* the `no-fi-prototype` directory. Then run this command

```
tiddlywiki no-fi-prototype --server
```

**3.** You may then proceed to build out your prototype, using wiki pages as screens.

## Best Practices ##
*(to be integrated into the prototyping framework)*

- I try to type in a verbal description of what I intend on displaying. This harkens back to those text-based adventure computer games.
- (probably, there is some easy way to actually make Tiddlywiki output buttons and stuff. Haven't learned how to do that just yet, but I'm pretty sure it's possible. Fork this project and teach us!)
